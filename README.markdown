**I have taken over maintenance of this Symfony 1.{3,4} plugin from Henrik Bj√∏rnskov, as he's now working Symfony2 eexclusively**

My current focus is to:

1. Work on the documentation. We're using this at my workplace on our
   Symfony 1.4 projects, but I remember it was a bit painful to get
working
2.  Better test coverage.

All pull requests welcome.
